# iri-task-management

This is a simple task management system that allows users to create, update, delete and view tasks. The website is built using Angular 17.

There are two pages in the website. The first page is the task list page where users can view all the tasks. The second page is the task form page where users can create a new task or update an existing task.

The website uses local storage to store the tasks. The tasks are stored in the local storage as a JSON string. When the user creates a new task, the task is added to the local storage. When the user updates a task, the task is updated in the local storage. When the user deletes a task, the task is removed from the local storage.

The website uses Angular Material for the UI components. The website uses RxJS for handling asynchronous operations. The website uses Angular Router for navigation between pages.


The website is hosted on Netlify [here](https://iri-task-management.netlify.app).
